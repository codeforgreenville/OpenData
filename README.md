UpstateEvents
=============
Please see the Wiki and Issues links in the right sidebar for the latest project updates.

We're building a REST API with Greenville area technology communities.

We intent to pull in meetup events for each community via whatever source available: iCal, Meetup.com API, Facebook, Eventbrite, Rich Snippets (Microdata, Microformats, RDFa), or even website scraping.

The REST API will be available for to consume to build tools.

One example tool/idea is to have a website to list tech community sponsorship needs (beer, food, coffee, space) and connect them with sponsors who are looking to offer such things.
